# NPuzzle

Java AI to solve the [sliding puzzle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) using the AStar algorithm.

This AI is capable of solving sliding puzzles of various sizes: 8puzzles, 15puzzles, NPuzzles, etc. However since this problem is considered NP-hard it can take a very long time to solve anything larger than a 15puzzle! As such, I reccomend you to stick to 8puzzles and 15puzzles unless you're going to run this AI in the background.

## Usage

To use this program, execute the jar file with the first argument the input file containing the sliding puzzle to be solved. 

An 8puzzle would be formatted like so:
8 6 7
2 5 4
3 0 1

You can leave the first argument out to let my program generate a random solvable sliding puzzle it will solve.
Examples for input and output files are contained in the root directory.

## About

I wrote this program originally for my highschool CS class in 2020. Since then I've graduated but I continue to make small changes and optimizations from time to time. Feel free to use this code as long as you give me credit.
