# EightPuzzleSolver

Java program to solve an 8puzzle using AStar algorithm.

Originally authored in 2020 for my Highschool Senior CS class, I reuploaded it in 2022 with some minor code quality changes and a better CLI.

Sample program input and output is contained in the repository root.

Usage: executablePath initialStateFilePath goalStateFilePath -o outputFilePath

initialStateFilePath and goalStateFilePath should match the format shown in the sample program input.
outputFilePath is optional, if not specified the program will output to sysout.
